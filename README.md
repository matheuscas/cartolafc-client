# CartolaFC Client

A personal, non-commercial project and for learning new technologies, using the CartolaFC as the background.
The main purpose is to create a desktop client. But as Ionic itâ€™s being used, you can also generate a apk to your, and only yours, personnal use. 

This project have used [this repo](https://github.com/noisedatalabs/ionicElectron) as a starter. Great work, by the way.
